"Such data may include aggregate data such as the number of click-throughs that occurred ."

"Site usage measurementOur site measurement tool uses a persistent cookie to assist us in measuring how and when our Web site and its various components are used ."
"It functions as a visit cookie , so that we can determine if you are a repeat visitor to our site ."
"This allows us to know if we are attracting new visitors and what aspects of the site seem most useful ."
"This is done for your safety to ensure that , if you have finished using our site , but have forgotten to log off , no one else can use your computer via your log-on and password ."
"Opt-in cookiesPersistent cookies allow us , at your request , to recognize you when you return to usps.com , or to remember certain information that you have provided us ."
"This allows us to personalize the site for you and tailor the content to your needs , for instance to show you other products you may be interested in ."
"Other cookies allow us to remember certain information related to prior transactions , such as package tracking numbers , or mailing or address lists , so that we may prepopulate those fields for you on return visits ."
"Ad banner cookiesOn behalf of the USPS , persistent cookies and beacons ( described below ) may be set and managed by third party advertising suppliers to support ad banners ."
"A Web beacon , also referred to as a clear gif or page tag , consists of code on the USPS site that delivers a small graphic image from another Web site or third party server ."

"Before sending any information about yourself over the Internet to us or anyone else , be sure to ask your parents for permission ."
"Here are some tips :"
"Know the sites your children are visiting and which sites are appropriate ."
"Official pages are generally recognizable by a standard page header and/or footer carrying the University logo , contact information and reference to this privacy statement ."
"Within the University of Florida domain signified by the address ufl.edu or within the range of Internet protocol addresses assigned to the University of Florida you may find Web sites over which the University has no editorial responsibility or control ."
"Such sites are considered unofficial and include , but are not limited to , the Web pages of individual faculty members or students and the Web pages of student organizations and other entities not formally a part of the University ."
"The Web Privacy Statement speaks generally to the information collected by or submitted to official University of Florida Web sites ."
"Still the amount and type of information collected may vary somewhat from site to site ."
"Therefore , in addition to this general explanation of policy and practice , the University encourages colleges , schools , departments , divisions and other units contributing to its official Web pages to post , as necessary , more specific approved privacy notices pertaining to the collection and use of any personal information associated exclusively with those pages ."

"In theory , the requested Web page and the routing information could be discerned by other entities involved in transmitting the requested page to you ."
"We may keep client information from our systems indefinitely after the Web page is transmitted , but we do not cross-reference it to the individuals who browse our Web site ."

"Usually a cookie enables the university Web site to tailor what you see according to the way you entered the site ( i.e. , if you entered by pushing a button identifying yourself as a student , your subsequent views of information might be tailored for student audiences ) ."
"For example , we may determine that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our Web site , or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out a particular registration form ."
"But we do not disclose information that could identify those specific individuals ."
"We do not share this information with outside parties , except to the extent necessary to complete that order or request ."

"Failure of your browser to provide nonessential technical information will not prevent your use of our Web site but may prevent certain features from working ."
"For any optional information that is requested at the Web site , failure to provide the requested information will mean that the particular feature or service associated with that part of the Web page may not be available to you ."
"Some UF Web sites present UF-sponsored information or activities that are specifically designed for children ."
"However , the Web sites are intended to be used only by adults to voluntarily share information online , so that a child who is under the age of 13 can participate in these activities ( e.g. , summer camps , classes , programs ) or so that the child can receive information mailed or e-mailed from UF ( newsletters , class schedules , recruitment information ) ."
"When a parent or legal guardian voluntarily signs their child up for one of these programs , the parent may be asked to provide :"
"UF , through its Web sites , does not condition participation in any of our online activities on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity ."
